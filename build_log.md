  - You can do it!
  - A few more seconds and you'll be god!
  - Go go go!
  - An apnea training a day, keeps the doctor away.
  - Imagine you're a jelly fish, floating in the deep blue sea.
  - Just...one more second.
  - Don't give up, never let down.
  - I am feeling very warm right now.
  - Just nod if you can hear me.
  - Hold on, hold on a sec.
